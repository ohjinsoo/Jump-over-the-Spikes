# Jump-over-the-Spikes
Fun game using Java where you control a box jumping over spikes.
I was able to create the Game Engine and LWJGL-related portions using a tutorial by YouTuber TheChernoProject in this [video linked here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=527bR2JHSR0) Everything else was developed by me.


### Dependencies
* `LWJGL 3` : Light Weight Java Game Library 3.
